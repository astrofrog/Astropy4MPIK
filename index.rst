MPIK Astropy Workshop
=====================

.. note:: Please bring your laptop to the workshop!

`Astropy <http://www.astropy.org>`_ is a community-developed core Python
package for Astronomy (with the term used in the broad sense, from Solar
System work to Cosmology). The first public release (v0.2) took place on
February 23rd 2013.

The scope of the workshop is not to give a complete introduction to Python,
but instead to make you familiar with Astropy so that you can directly use it
in your work/research. The functionality is presented in such a way that
beginners in Python should be able to follow, but please ensure that you have
a functional Python distribution installed prior to the workshop.

The format of the workshop will be to have several ~20 minute sessions to look
at different parts of Astropy. In each session, I will spend 5-10 minutes
presenting the basic functionality of a given package, during which you are
encouraged to follow along. The remaining time (10-15 minutes) will be spent
on practical exercises. Each session will have exercises of increasing
difficulty, so that both beginners and experienced users can find something at
their level.

Advanced users can always go and look at the `documentation
<http://docs.astropy.org/en/v0.2/>`_ if certain topics (e.g. running Python
and data types) are already known.
